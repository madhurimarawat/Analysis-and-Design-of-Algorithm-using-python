<h1>Algorithm Analysis</h1>
--> Algorithm analysis is an important part of computational complexity theory, which provides theoretical estimation for the required resources of an algorithm to solve a specific computational problem.<br><br>
--> Analysis of algorithms is the determination of the amount of time and space resources required to execute it.<br><br>

<h1>Importance of Algorithm Analysis</h1>
--> To predict the behavior of an algorithm without implementing it on a specific computer.<br><br>
--> It is much more convenient to have simple measures for the efficiency of an algorithm than to implement the algorithm and test the efficiency every time a certain parameter in the underlying computer system changes.<br><br>
--> More importantly, by analyzing different algorithms, we can compare them to determine the best one for our purpose.<br>
<h1>Types of Algorithm Analysis:</h1>
<ol>
<li>Best case</li>
<li>Worst case</li>
<li>Average case</li></ol>
