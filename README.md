--> The word Algorithm means-  A set of finite rules or instructions to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations.<br><br>
--> Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing. <br><br>

<h1>Algorithm Analysis</h1>
--> Algorithm analysis is an important part of computational complexity theory, which provides theoretical estimation for the required resources of an algorithm to solve a specific computational problem.<br><br>
--> Analysis of algorithms is the determination of the amount of time and space resources required to execute it.<br><br>

<h1>Importance of Algorithm Analysis</h1>
--> To predict the behavior of an algorithm without implementing it on a specific computer.<br><br>
--> It is much more convenient to have simple measures for the efficiency of an algorithm than to implement the algorithm and test the efficiency every time a certain parameter in the underlying computer system changes.<br><br>
--> More importantly, by analyzing different algorithms, we can compare them to determine the best one for our purpose.<br>
<h1>Types of Algorithm Analysis:</h1>
<ol>
<li>Best case</li>
<li>Worst case</li>
<li>Average case</li></ol>

# Mode of Execution used <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/python/python-original-wordmark.svg" title="Python" alt="python language" width="40" height="40"> 

--> Visit the official website of python:  <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"><img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/python/python-original-wordmark.svg" title="Python" alt="python language" width="40" height="40"> </a> <br><br>
--> Download according to the platform that will be used . <br><br>
--> Python programs are written in editors and saved as the file with the .py extension which can be executed further. <br>
<br>
--> We can directly run this file on command prompt as well by giving the file name and .py extention.
